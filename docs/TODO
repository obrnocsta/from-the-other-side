# Routes & Paths

## Intro (new)

**Our three main tasks:**
- Server assets
- Provide data via an API
- Add user input to our data

**Extra:**
- A section on events

**We will be studying:**
- The 'fs' module
  - reading/writing files
- The 'path' module
  - create file/directory paths

## Setting up the project

**Challenge:**

```bash
# 1. 
#   Initialise a nodejs project:
#   Name: “from-the-other-side”.
#   Description: “A platform for sharing ghostly encounters”.
# 2.
#   Enable modular js (in package.json).
```

**Hint for help:**

```bash
# In terminal:
npm init

# In package.json: 
"type": "module"
```

**Challenge:**

````bash
# 1.
#   Set up a server that serves the string 
#   '<html><h1>The server is working</h1></html>'.
#   What should the content type be? 
#   What status code should you send?

# 2. 
#   Listen on port 8000 and log a connection message to the console.

# 3. 
#   Open the browser to see your first served HTML.
```
